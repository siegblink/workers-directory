Unauthenticated users are automatically redirected to `/login`.

### Client vs Server Authentication

```typescript
// Client Component
import { createClient } from "@/lib/supabase/client"
const supabase = createClient()

// Server Component / Server Action
import { createClient } from "@/lib/supabase/server"
const supabase = await createClient()
```

## Adding shadcn/ui Components

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add [component-name]
```

Components will be automatically added to the `components/ui/` directory.

## Styling

- Global styles: `app/globals.css`
- Theme variables: CSS variables in `:root` and `.dark`
- Component styling: Tailwind CSS with `cn()` utility
- Fonts: Geist Sans and Geist Mono

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase project URL | Yes |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Supabase anonymous key | Yes |
